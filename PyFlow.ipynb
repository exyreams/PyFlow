        "\n",
        "**Hackathon Context:** This notebook is developed for the **PayPal x Google Cloud Web3 Bounty**, demonstrating how **Google Cloud Platform's Blockchain Node Engine** unlocks powerful, cost-effective analysis of the **PayPal USD (PYUSD)** stablecoin on Ethereum.\n",

        "## The Challenge: Unlocking Deep Blockchain Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the intricate movements, internal logic, and real-world interactions of stablecoins like **PYUSD** often requires deep, computationally intensive blockchain analysis. Standard block explorers and basic RPC calls provide only surface-level data, while accessing advanced tracing and state inspection methods on most platforms is prohibitively expensive or heavily rate-limited due to their high computational demands.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Solution: PyFlow leveraging GCP's Advantage\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook, **PyFlow**, provides a comprehensive toolkit for advanced PYUSD analysis by specifically utilizing **Google Cloud Platform's premium RPC debug and trace methods**.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **🚀 GCP's Unique Offering: Cost-Effective Access to High-Multiplier Methods**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Many advanced RPC methods carry significant **request multipliers** due to their computational intensity. For example, a method with a `50x` multiplier consumes the equivalent quota/cost of 50 basic calls (like `eth_call`). Methods like `trace_replayTransaction` have an even higher `100x` multiplier.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **GCP's Blockchain Node Engine stands out by offering generous free quotas even for these high-multiplier methods**, effectively democratizing access to capabilities previously reserved for specialized infrastructure or high budgets.\n",

        "*   **Security Investigations:** Replaying failed transactions (`trace_replayTransaction`, `100x`) or examining state changes (`stateDiff` via replay).\n",
        "*   **Smart Contract Auditing:** Verifying internal logic, storage layout (`debug_storageRangeAt`, `50x`), and event emission (`eth_getLogs`, `50x`).\n",

        "*   **State & Data Retrieval:**\n",
        "    *   `eth_getLogs` (`50x`): Efficiently fetch specific PYUSD events (e.g., Transfers, Approvals).\n",
        "    *   `eth_getCode` (`10x`): Retrieve deployed contract bytecode.\n",
        "    *   `debug_storageRangeAt` (`50x`): Inspect raw contract storage slots.\n",

        "### 📋 Step 1: Provide Your GCP Credentials\n",
        "\n",
        "To use GCP's Blockchain RPC and potentially Google Sheets, you need:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Your GCP Project ID:**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** Identifies your Google Cloud project, primarily used here to scope authentication requests for Google Drive/Sheets access.\n",
        "    *   **How to Obtain:** If you don't have one, create it at [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).\n",
        "    *   **➡️ ACTION REQUIRED:** Find the `GCP_PROJECT_ID` variable in the code below and replace `\"YOUR_PROJECT_ID\"` with your actual Project ID string.\n",
        "2.  **Your GCP Blockchain RPC Endpoints (with API Key):**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** Secure URLs to connect to Ethereum Mainnet and testnets via GCP. This is key to interacting with the blockchain using `web3.py`.\n",
        "    *   **How to Obtain:**\n",
        "        1.  Go to the [GCP Blockchain Node Engine Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/blockchain/node-engine) in your project.\n",
        "        2.  Enable the API if you haven't already.\n",
        "        3.  Copy the **full HTTPS RPC endpoint URL** (including `?key=...`) for **Ethereum Mainnet**. Optionally, copy URLs for testnets (Holesky, Sepolia) if needed.\n",
        "    *   **➡️ ACTION REQUIRED:** Find the `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC` dictionary in the code below. Replace the placeholder URLs (e.g., `\"https://blockchain.googleapis.com/...\"`) with your *complete* copied endpoint URLs for `'mainnet'`, `'holesky'`, and `'sepolia'`.\n",

        "> #### **💡Tip: Follow README for Video Instructions.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔐 Step 3: Run the Cell & Authenticate\n",
        "\n",
        "When you execute the code cell below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  It will define constants (like PYUSD contract addresses) and configurations (trace settings).\n",
        "2.  It will attempt to **authenticate** your Google account (via a pop-up in Colab) to grant access to the enabled GCP services needed for Google Sheets (Drive, Sheets). Follow the prompts.\n",
        "3.  It will initialize `web3.py` clients using your provided RPC endpoints.\n",
        "4.  It will initialize a client for Google Sheets (`gspread`).\n",
        "5.  It will perform **connection tests** (check RPC node block height) and display a status summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Double-check that you have replaced the placeholder `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and the **full** `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC` URLs before running. The notebook relies heavily on a successful connection to the **Ethereum Mainnet** endpoint via GCP for most subsequent analysis."
