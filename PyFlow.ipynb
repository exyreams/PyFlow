        "\n",
        "**Hackathon Context:** This notebook is developed for the **PayPal x Google Cloud Web3 Bounty**, demonstrating how **Google Cloud Platform's Blockchain Node Engine** unlocks powerful, cost-effective analysis of the **PayPal USD (PYUSD)** stablecoin on Ethereum.\n",

        "## The Challenge: Unlocking Deep Blockchain Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the intricate movements, internal logic, and real-world interactions of stablecoins like **PYUSD** often requires deep, computationally intensive blockchain analysis. Standard block explorers and basic RPC calls provide only surface-level data, while accessing advanced tracing and state inspection methods on most platforms is prohibitively expensive or heavily rate-limited due to their high computational demands.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Solution: PyFlow leveraging GCP's Advantage\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook, **PyFlow**, provides a comprehensive toolkit for advanced PYUSD analysis by specifically utilizing **Google Cloud Platform's premium RPC debug and trace methods**.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **🚀 GCP's Unique Offering: Cost-Effective Access to High-Multiplier Methods**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Many advanced RPC methods carry significant **request multipliers** due to their computational intensity. For example, a method with a `50x` multiplier consumes the equivalent quota/cost of 50 basic calls (like `eth_call`). Methods like `trace_replayTransaction` have an even higher `100x` multiplier.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **GCP's Blockchain Node Engine stands out by offering generous free quotas even for these high-multiplier methods**, effectively democratizing access to capabilities previously reserved for specialized infrastructure or high budgets.\n",

        "    *   `eth_getCode` (`10x`): Retrieve deployed contract bytecode.\n",
        "    *   `debug_storageRangeAt` (`50x`): Inspect raw contract storage slots.\n",

        "### 📋 Step 1: Provide Your GCP Credentials\n",
        "\n",
        "To use GCP's Blockchain RPC and potentially Google Sheets, you need:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Your GCP Project ID:**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** Identifies your Google Cloud project, primarily used here to scope authentication requests for Google Drive/Sheets access.\n",
        "    *   **How to Obtain:** If you don't have one, create it at [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).\n",
        "    *   **➡️ ACTION REQUIRED:** Find the `GCP_PROJECT_ID` variable in the code below and replace `\"YOUR_PROJECT_ID\"` with your actual Project ID string.\n",
        "2.  **Your GCP Blockchain RPC Endpoints (with API Key):**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** Secure URLs to connect to Ethereum Mainnet and testnets via GCP. This is key to interacting with the blockchain using `web3.py`.\n",
        "    *   **How to Obtain:**\n",
        "        1.  Go to the [GCP Blockchain Node Engine Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/blockchain/node-engine) in your project.\n",
        "        2.  Enable the API if you haven't already.\n",
        "        3.  Copy the **full HTTPS RPC endpoint URL** (including `?key=...`) for **Ethereum Mainnet**. Optionally, copy URLs for testnets (Holesky, Sepolia) if needed.\n",
        "    *   **➡️ ACTION REQUIRED:** Find the `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC` dictionary in the code below. Replace the placeholder URLs (e.g., `\"https://blockchain.googleapis.com/...\"`) with your *complete* copied endpoint URLs for `'mainnet'`, `'holesky'`, and `'sepolia'`.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 🔐 Step 3: Run the Cell & Authenticate\n",
        "\n",
        "When you execute the code cell below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  It will define constants (like PYUSD contract addresses) and configurations (trace settings).\n",
        "2.  It will attempt to **authenticate** your Google account (via a pop-up in Colab) to grant access to the enabled GCP services needed for Google Sheets (Drive, Sheets). Follow the prompts.\n",
        "3.  It will initialize `web3.py` clients using your provided RPC endpoints.\n",
        "4.  It will initialize a client for Google Sheets (`gspread`).\n",
        "5.  It will perform **connection tests** (check RPC node block height) and display a status summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Double-check that you have replaced the placeholder `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and the **full** `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC` URLs before running. The notebook relies heavily on a successful connection to the **Ethereum Mainnet** endpoint via GCP for most subsequent analysis."

        "\n",
        "The `structLog` tracer dives deep into the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), providing a step-by-step log of each opcode executed during the transaction. For each step, it details the program counter (PC), opcode, remaining gas, gas cost, stack contents, memory state, and storage changes (if enabled).\n",

        "> *   **Multiplier:** `50x` (Same base multiplier as `callTracer`, but output size is *significantly* larger)\n",
        "> *   **Output Size:** Can generate **very large** outputs (potentially hundreds of thousands of steps/lines, consuming significant memory/browser resources) for even moderately complex transactions.\n",
        "> *   **Use Case:** Best suited for highly specific debugging tasks, deep gas optimization analysis at the opcode level, or verifying precise execution paths, rather than general transaction overview. **Use with caution.**\n",

        "> **🚀 Leveraging GCP's Premium RPC Capabilities**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> *   **GCP Advantage:** While the base multiplier is `50x`, the sheer volume of data returned by `structLog` makes it extremely demanding on RPC node resources. GCP's infrastructure and generous quotas make it feasible to retrieve these detailed traces where other providers might time out, restrict output size, or charge heavily.\n",
        "> *   **PYUSD Insight:** `structLog` can be used for:\n",

        "4.  **Summarize & Visualize:**\n",
        "    *   **Overview:** Displays total steps, gas cost, call depth, and highlights PYUSD execution percentage.\n",

        "*   **Execution Timeline:** Observe gas depletion patterns. Look for sharp drops corresponding to expensive operations. Note the percentage of time spent executing PYUSD code.\n",
        "*   **Data Sample:** Understand the structure of the per-opcode data (PC, gas, stack, memory).\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "This section focuses on retrieving specific **event logs** emitted by the PYUSD smart contract. Events are a crucial mechanism for contracts to signal occurrences (like transfers or approvals) to the outside world. `eth_getLogs` provides a highly efficient way to query these events directly from the blockchain's indexed log data, avoiding the need to process non-relevant transactions or blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we specifically target the standard ERC-20 `Transfer(address,address,uint256)` event emitted by the PYUSD contract to track token movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **🚀 Leveraging GCP's Blockchain Node Engine**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> *   **Method:** `eth_getLogs`\n",
        "> *   **Quota Multiplier:** `50x` (Indicates this method consumes 50x the request quota compared to a basic call like `eth_getBlockByNumber` under GCP's Blockchain Node Engine pricing model).\n",
        "> *   **GCP Integration & Limits:** While `eth_getLogs` is standard, node performance and limitations vary. Public or lower-tier nodes often impose strict limits on the query block range (e.g., 10,000 blocks) or total logs returned (e.g., 10,000 logs). Furthermore, specific endpoints, like the Google Blockchain Node Engine endpoint potentially used here (`blockchain.googleapis.com`), may enforce even tighter constraints (like the **5-block range limit** handled explicitly in the code). GCP's advantage often lies in providing reliable performance, consistent availability, and potentially higher throughput or more permissive limits on its paid tiers compared to shared public endpoints.\n",
        "> *   **PYUSD Insight:** `eth_getLogs` enables us to:\n",
        ">     *   Quickly find **all PYUSD `Transfer` events** within a specific block or a (potentially limited) range of blocks.\n",
        ">     *   Efficiently track PYUSD **velocity and volume** over time by fetching logs incrementally.\n",
        ">     *   Identify **top senders and receivers** of PYUSD within a given period.\n",
        ">     *   Monitor other PYUSD events (like `Approval`, `Paused`, `Unpaused`) by changing the queried `topic`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analysis Workflow:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Define Filter:** The code configures a filter targeting the main PYUSD contract address (`PYUSD_CONFIG['ethereum']['address']`) and the specific topic hash for the `Transfer` event. It also specifies the target block(s) (e.g., `TARGET_BLOCK_IDENTIFIER`, 'latest', or a range).\n",
        "2.  **Fetch Logs:** Calls `eth_getLogs` via the `web3.py` client. If a Google API endpoint is detected, it uses direct JSON-RPC requests to handle potential specific constraints (like the 5-block limit).\n",
        "3.  **Parse & Decode:** The returned raw log data is parsed, extracting the `from` address, `to` address, and `value` (amount) for each `Transfer` event. PYUSD amounts are formatted using the correct 6 decimals (`PYUSD_CONFIG['ethereum']['decimals']`). Timestamps are fetched for context.\n",
        "4.  **Analyze & Visualize:**\n",
        "    *   **Data Table:** Displays a sample of the fetched transfer events (showing full addresses).\n",
        "    *   **Statistics:** Calculates and shows key metrics (total transfers, volume, unique addresses) in a summary table.\n",
        "    *   **Top Movers:** Identifies and tables the top senders and receivers by volume (showing full addresses).\n",
        "    *   **Visualizations:** Generates plots showing transfer size distribution, volume over time (if timestamps available), and a network graph (Sankey diagram) of top transfer flows.\n",
        "    *   **Export Options:** Provides buttons to download the parsed transfer data (CSV, JSON) or export to Google Sheets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**💡 What to Look For:**\n",
        "*   **Transfer Volume & Count:** Assess the PYUSD activity level within the queried block(s)/range.\n",
        "*   **Top Senders/Receivers:** Identify major players interacting with PYUSD. Are they exchanges, bridges, protocols, or individual wallets?\n",
        "*   **Network Graph:** Visualize the primary flow of PYUSD between addresses for the top flows.\n",
        "*   **Timestamp Data (if available):** Observe any time-based patterns in transfer activity."

        "*   **Basic Functionality Identification:** Detecting potential function signatures (like standard ERC-20 functions or *potentially* PYUSD-specific ones *if included in the tool's known signature set*) present within the bytecode. *Note that this relies on matching known 4-byte selectors found via bytecode patterns and is a heuristic approach, not a full decompilation.*\n",

        "\n",
        "Unlike `trace_block` (from the `trace` namespace), these `debug_` methods often provide **more detailed trace outputs for *each* transaction** within the block, typically defaulting to a format similar to `debug_traceTransaction`'s `callTracer` on GCP. This allows for a deeper analysis of the internal execution flow of every transaction in the target block.\n",

        "> *   **Multiplier:** `50x` (Each method call)\n",
        "> *   **GCP Advantage:** Tracing full blocks with this level of detail per transaction is highly resource-intensive. GCP's infrastructure and free quotas make it feasible to retrieve and process these potentially very large and numerous trace results efficiently.\n",

        "\n",
        "This section utilizes a **multi-stage simulation approach** to analyze potential PYUSD transactions *without* broadcasting them or requiring real gas/ETH. It intelligently combines standard and advanced RPC methods (`eth.call`, `eth.estimate_gas`, and optionally `debug_traceCall`/`trace_call`) to provide comprehensive insights based on a specific block state.\n",
        "\n",
        "This hybrid strategy is incredibly useful for:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Pre-flight Validation (`eth.call`):** Quickly checking if a transaction would likely revert due to basic errors (invalid parameters, immediate contract logic failure).\n",
        "*   **Gas Estimation (`eth.estimate_gas`):** Predicting the gas cost *before* sending, allowing for optimization and budget planning. The code uses this as the primary gas source unless a trace provides a more accurate figure.\n",
        "*   **Revert Debugging (`eth.call` Error + Trace):** Understanding *why* a potential transaction might fail by analyzing the initial revert reason or, if tracing is enabled, examining the detailed execution path and internal calls.\n",
        "*   **State Change Analysis (Trace Events):** Observing the potential impact of operations like `transfer` or `approve` by decoding specific events (e.g., `Transfer` event) emitted during the simulated trace.\n",
        "*   **\"What-If\" Analysis & Comparison:** Testing different parameters for PYUSD functions to compare outcomes, gas costs (`eth.estimate_gas`), and execution details (trace).\n",
        "\n",
        "> **🚀 Leveraging GCP's Premium RPC Capabilities**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> *   **Methods:** `eth.call`, `eth.estimate_gas`, `debug_traceCall` (preferred for tracing), `trace_call` (fallback)\n",
        "> *   **Multiplier for `debug_traceCall`/`trace_call`:** `50x` (Available on Mainnet via GCP)\n",
        "> *   **GCP Advantage:** Simulating complex transactions and obtaining detailed execution traces via `debug_traceCall` (especially those interacting with multiple contracts) is resource-intensive. GCP allows these detailed simulations efficiently on Mainnet.\n",

        ">     *   Robust **pre-flight checks** for PYUSD transfers, approvals, mints, burns.\n",

        ">     *   Debugging potential integration issues by simulating calls *from* other contracts *to* the PYUSD contract and analyzing the trace.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analysis Workflow (as implemented in the code):**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Define Call & Pre-Check:**\n",
        "    *   Constructs the transaction call dictionary (`from`, `to`, `data`, etc.).\n",
        "    *   Performs an optional, preliminary PYUSD balance check (`estimate_pyusd_balance` using `eth.call`) for relevant operations to provide immediate context.\n",
        "2.  **Stage 1: Basic Simulation (`eth.call`):**\n",
        "    *   *Always* executes `eth.call` first to get an immediate success/fail status and potential revert data.\n",
        "3.  **Stage 2: Gas Estimation (`eth.estimate_gas`):**\n",
        "    *   If `eth.call` succeeded OR failed *only* due to insufficient balance (indicating the logic is otherwise sound), it attempts `eth.estimate_gas` to get the predicted gas cost. This value is stored as the primary `gas_used`.\n",
        "4.  **Stage 3: Detailed Tracing (Optional - `debug_traceCall`/`trace_call`):**\n",
        "    *   If `use_trace=True` and the simulation is plausible (success or hypothetical success from Stage 2), it attempts detailed tracing.\n",
        "    *   It prioritizes `debug_traceCall`, using the `make_rpc_request` helper to try multiple parameter formats for maximum compatibility (essential for providers like GCP).\n",
        "    *   If `debug_traceCall` fails across formats, it attempts `trace_call` as a fallback.\n",
        "5.  **Analyze & Assemble Results:**\n",
        "    *   The `simulate_pyusd_transaction` function gathers results into an `analysis` dictionary.\n",
        "    *   It decodes known ERC-20/PYUSD errors from `eth.call` failures.\n",
        "    *   It categorizes gas usage based on the estimated gas and function type.\n",
        "    *   **If a trace was successful:** It parses the `trace_result` to potentially refine `gas_used` (if available in trace), extract internal calls, and identify `state_changes` by decoding specific emitted events (like PYUSD `Transfer` logs) found within the trace.\n",
        "    *   It decodes the return `output` for view functions (like `balanceOf`).\n",
        "6.  **Visualize & Export:**\n",
        "    *   Uses `display_simulation_analysis` to present a structured summary: function details, execution results (status, gas, errors, decoded output), state changes (from trace events), and transaction flow diagrams.\n",
        "    *   Leverages `compare_pyusd_transactions` and `batch_simulate_pyusd_transactions` for multi-run analysis with comparison tables and charts.\n",
        "    *   Provides export options (CSV, JSON, Google Sheets) via helper functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**💡 What to Look For:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Status:** Did `eth.call` succeed? If not, what was the decoded error? Is it a \"Hypothetical Success\" (meaning `eth.estimate_gas` worked even if the initial balance was too low)?\n",
        "*   **Gas Used:** What is the `eth.estimate_gas` value? Was it refined by a value from the trace? How does it compare across different parameters (in comparison mode)?\n",
        "*   **Gas Profile:** How does the gas usage categorize (Efficient, Medium, High) for this type of operation?\n",
        "*   **Decoded Output:** For view functions (`balanceOf`, `allowance`), what is the simulated return value?\n",
        "*   **State Changes (from Trace):** If tracing was enabled, were any key events (like `Transfer`) detected in the execution trace, indicating simulated state modifications?\n",
        "*   **Internal Calls (from Trace):** Does the trace reveal calls made by the PYUSD contract to other contracts?"
