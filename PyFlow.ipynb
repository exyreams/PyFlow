        "Understanding the intricate movements, internal logic, and real-world interactions of stablecoins like **PYUSD** often requires deep, computationally intensive blockchain analysis. Standard block explorers and basic RPC calls provide only surface-level data, while accessing advanced tracing and state inspection methods on most platforms is prohibitively expensive or heavily rate-limited due to their high computational demands.\n",

        "> Many advanced RPC methods carry significant **request multipliers** due to their computational intensity. For example, a method with a `50x` multiplier consumes the equivalent quota/cost of 50 basic calls (like `eth_call`). Methods like `trace_replayTransaction` have an even higher `100x` multiplier.\n",
