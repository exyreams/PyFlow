        "\n",
        "**Hackathon Context:** This notebook is developed for the **PayPal x Google Cloud Web3 Bounty**, demonstrating how **Google Cloud Platform's Blockchain Node Engine** unlocks powerful, cost-effective analysis of the **PayPal USD (PYUSD)** stablecoin on Ethereum.\n",

        "## The Challenge: Unlocking Deep Blockchain Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the intricate movements, internal logic, and real-world interactions of stablecoins like **PYUSD** often requires deep, computationally intensive blockchain analysis. Standard block explorers and basic RPC calls provide only surface-level data, while accessing advanced tracing and state inspection methods on most platforms is prohibitively expensive or heavily rate-limited due to their high computational demands.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Solution: PyFlow leveraging GCP's Advantage\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook, **PyFlow**, provides a comprehensive toolkit for advanced PYUSD analysis by specifically utilizing **Google Cloud Platform's premium RPC debug and trace methods**.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **🚀 GCP's Unique Offering: Cost-Effective Access to High-Multiplier Methods**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Many advanced RPC methods carry significant **request multipliers** due to their computational intensity. For example, a method with a `50x` multiplier consumes the equivalent quota/cost of 50 basic calls (like `eth_call`). Methods like `trace_replayTransaction` have an even higher `100x` multiplier.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **GCP's Blockchain Node Engine stands out by offering generous free quotas even for these high-multiplier methods**, effectively democratizing access to capabilities previously reserved for specialized infrastructure or high budgets.\n",

        "*   **Security Investigations:** Replaying failed transactions (`trace_replayTransaction`, `100x`) or examining state changes (`stateDiff` via replay).\n",
        "*   **Smart Contract Auditing:** Verifying internal logic, storage layout (`debug_storageRangeAt`, `50x`), and event emission (`eth_getLogs`, `50x`).\n",

        "*   **State & Data Retrieval:**\n",
        "    *   `eth_getLogs` (`50x`): Efficiently fetch specific PYUSD events (e.g., Transfers, Approvals).\n",
        "    *   `eth_getCode` (`10x`): Retrieve deployed contract bytecode.\n",
        "    *   `debug_storageRangeAt` (`50x`): Inspect raw contract storage slots.\n",
