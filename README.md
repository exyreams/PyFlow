# üìä PyFlow: Advanced PYUSD Analysis with GCP Blockchain Node Engine

**Submission for the PayPal x Google Cloud Web3 Bounty** üöÄ
**PyFlow** is an analytics platform, presented as a Google Colaboratory notebook, designed for deep analysis of the **PayPal USD (PYUSD)** stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages the unique capabilities of **Google Cloud Platform's Blockchain Node Engine**, specifically its generous free quotas for computationally expensive RPC methods, to provide insights typically inaccessible or cost-prohibitive with standard tools.

## ü§î Problem Statement

Analyzing stablecoins like PYUSD often requires more than surface-level transaction data. Understanding complex interactions (DeFi swaps, bridging), debugging failures, optimizing gas, auditing security, or verifying state requires deep execution tracing and state inspection. However, the underlying RPC methods (`debug_traceTransaction`, `trace_replayTransaction`, `stateDiff`, etc.) are computationally intensive. Accessing them via standard RPC providers typically involves:
*  **üí∏ High Costs:** Significant fees based on computation or request multipliers.
*  **‚è±Ô∏è Strict Rate Limits:** Limiting the frequency or volume of analysis.
*  **üö´ Limited Availability:** Some advanced methods may not be offered at all.

This creates a barrier to performing thorough, cost-effective analysis, especially for developers, analysts, or smaller teams.

## ‚ú® Solution: PyFlow & The GCP Advantage
PyFlow addresses this challenge by building directly on **Google Cloud's Blockchain Node Engine**.
**Key Advantage:** GCP uniquely offers **generous free quotas** for computationally expensive, high-multiplier RPC methods (like `debug_traceTransaction` (50x), `trace_replayTransaction` (100x), `eth_getLogs` (50x), `debug_storageRangeAt` (50x), etc.).

PyFlow leverages this by providing a **Google Colab notebook** üìù that acts as an interactive analysis platform. It allows users to easily execute these powerful GCP methods against specific PYUSD transactions, blocks, or contracts and presents the results with detailed parsing, analysis, and visualizations üìà. This makes deep blockchain intelligence accessible and affordable.

## üöÄ Features & Methods Covered
PyFlow implements analysis workflows for a wide range of advanced RPC methods, focusing on PYUSD insights:
*  **Detailed Execution Tracing:**  `debug_traceTransaction` (callTracer/structLog), `trace_transaction`
*  *Insights:* Internal call flow, gas usage per step, event emission, function parameters, revert debugging.
*  **Block-Level Analysis:**  `trace_block`, `debug_traceBlockByNumber`, `debug_traceBlockByHash`
*  *Insights:* Activity overview for all transactions in a block, contextual analysis around PYUSD txns, block-level gas patterns, MEV hints.
*  **State Replay & Simulation:**  `trace_replayTransaction`, `trace_replayBlockTransactions` (with `stateDiff`, `trace`), `trace_call`
*  *Insights:* Precise state change tracking (balances, storage), debugging failed txns, gas estimation, "what-if" scenario analysis.
*  **State & Data Retrieval:**  `eth_getLogs`, `eth_getCode`, `debug_storageRangeAt`.
*  *Insights:* Efficient event querying (Transfers, Approvals), contract bytecode verification, raw storage inspection, Merkle proof generation and verification.
*  **Network Monitoring:**  `txpool_status`
*  *Insights:* Network congestion analysis, estimated confirmation times, gas price recommendations.
*(See the notebook for detailed explanations and multipliers for each method.)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
Following these steps will allow you to run the PyFlow notebook successfully.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
1.  **Google Account:** Required for Google Colab and GCP access.
2.  **Google Cloud Project:** A GCP project with billing enabled (required for API usage, though free quotas are generous). Create one [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).
3.  **Enabled GCP APIs:** Ensure the following APIs are **enabled** in your GCP project:
* Blockchain Node Engine API ([Enable Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/blockchain/rpc?referrer=search&invt=AbupKA))
* Google Drive API ([Enable Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com))
* Google Sheets API ([Enable Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com))

[Prerequisites.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/755a58e9-be6a-4a55-afe8-a977b88a31a2)

### üîë Configuration
1.  **Open the Notebook:** Click the "Open In Colab" badge at the top of this README or directly open the `PyFlow.ipynb` file in Google Colaboratory.
2.  **Edit Cell 2 (üîë Configuration & Authentication: Connecting to GCP and Ethereum RPC):** This is the **only cell you need to manually edit**.
*  **`BLOCKCHAIN_RPC` Dictionary:** Replace the placeholder URLs with your **full** GCP RPC endpoint URLs (including `?key=...`) for `'mainnet'` and optionally `'holesky'` and `'sepolia'`.
*  **`GCP_PROJECT_ID`:** Replace `"YOUR_PROJECT_ID"` with your actual GCP Project ID string.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Notebook
1.  **Connect Runtime:** In Colab, ensure you are connected to a runtime (Runtime > Connect to runtime). A standard runtime is usually sufficient, but High-RAM is recommended for large block analyses.
2.  **Run Setup Cells:**
* Run **Cell 1 (üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup: Installing Dependencies for PyFlow)** to install dependencies (takes 1-2 minutes).
* Run **Cell 2 (üîë Configuration & Authentication: Connecting to GCP and Ethereum RPC)**. You will be prompted to authenticate with your Google Account via a pop-up. Follow the instructions. Verify that the output shows successful connections (RPC).
3.  **Run Analysis Cells:** Proceed through the notebook section by section (1.1 through 1.11).
*  **Modify Targets:** In Cell 1.1, you can change the default `TARGET_TX_HASH` and `TARGET_BLOCK_IDENTIFIER`.
*  **Enable Expensive Calls:** Some cells (like `structLog`, `replay*`) have flags (`RUN_... = True/False`). Set them to `True` cautiously to run those analyses.
*  **Use Interactive Widgets:** Some sections provide interactive widgets (dropdowns, text boxes, buttons) for filtering or changing inputs directly in the output.
